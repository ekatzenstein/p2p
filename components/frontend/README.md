# Jupyter-React-Example

A completely working example of how to leverage any react component inside a Jupyter NbExtension using [Jupyter-React](https://github.com/timbr-io/jupyter-react) and [Jupyter-React-JS](https://github.com/timbr-io/jupyter-react-js).

## Running Stand Alone App

```
See root directory README (work in progress as of writing)
```


## Jupyter Notebook Custom Charts

```
npm install (if you haven't already)
npm run jupyter-build
```

- This should open up the jupyter notebook automatically (located in `./jupyter`). Open `pandastoproduction.ipynb` in the Jupyter notebook, the cell as of interest as of writing is `9`.
- The components created are in the `example` folder as a collection of `.py` files and static `.js` files.

## Usage

Inside a Jupyter Notebook

`open example_p2p.ipynb`
